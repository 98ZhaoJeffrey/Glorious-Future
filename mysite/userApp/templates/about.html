<h1>What is this site</h1>
<h4>
    In 2020, the American student debt crisis has risen to over 1.5 trillion dollars spread 
    across only 45 million young and bright student. Why are schools punishing students for pursing 
    their dreams? Worst yet, Black and Hispanic students owe more than other races since their loans 
    have greater interest rates. Debt imprisons people to frugal and harash lives, despite university 
    being known as the gateway to success. However, this burden can be relieved by scholarships.
    Only 8.1% of the population recieve some pocketchange to pay for their degrees. Our website strives 
    to connect students, especially marginalized students, to scholarship organizations to recieve 
    as much aid as needed. If you're a highschool student or organization, continue reading.
